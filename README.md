# 👋 Hey, I'm nedcodes

I test .cursorrules so you don't have to.

I run before/after comparisons through Cursor CLI to find rules that actually change the output. Most don't. The ones that do end up in my packs.

## What I've found

Rules that work share three properties: they're **specific** (exact patterns, not vibes), **verifiable** (you can check compliance in a 2-second code review), and **additive** (they ask for something Cursor wouldn't do by default).
